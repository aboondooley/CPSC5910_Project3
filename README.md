# CPSC5910_Project3
Third project for CPSC 5091 Data Structures for the Computer Science Funamentals Certificate at Seattle University. In this project we implemented a template for a Binary Search Tree which can contain any primative type. Methods to return the number of leaves, the height, pre, post, and inorder traversals, as well as others were implemented. A test file was created to test all of the functionality. The BST is filled out by reading in text from a file.
